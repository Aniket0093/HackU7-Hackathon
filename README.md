Estate block: The next-gen real estate

From asset management and investments to operating and management companies, blockchain could potentially have a profound impact across the real estate.

We are trying to open up more possibilities, increase trust and enhance the overall experience of the players in a home buying process.

Some of the problems today with the traditional real estate:
> Severe lack of transparency
> High fees
> Transaction Speed
> Lack of trust among entities
We are using blockchain and cryptocurrency as a solution in many facets of commercial real estate transactions including property and title searches, financing, leasing, purchasing and selling, due diligence, managing cash flows, and payment management, including cross-border transactions.

With the attempt to enhance the home buying and selling experience, blockchainâ€™s impact will be an unparalleled paradigm shift for the real estate industry going forward.
